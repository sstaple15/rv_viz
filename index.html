      <h1 class = 'title'>Introduction</h1>
      <p class = 'notbold'>RapidVisa is providing evidence-based reporting on the US Visa regime, with special emphasis on the visas in which we work most. For this inaugural report, RapidVisa has culled through multiple datasets—both those provided by the US Government as well as our own proprietary data—to examine trends of K1 visa applications. More specifically, we examine both macro application trends and more granular statistics related to destinations, occupations and demographics of applicants and sponsors.  Several interesting trends emerge as vestiges of the visa’s origins. More broadly, this report is intended to shed light on a topic that is frequently misunderstood and poorly reported.

      <h1 class = 'title'>The K-1 Visa: A Brief Background</h1>
      <h3>What is a K-type visa?</h3>
      <p class = 'notbold'> K type visas are nonimmigrant visas for foreign fiances and spouses (and children) of U.S. citizens who wish to enter the United States while waiting on immigrant application adjudication. K type visa designees are distinguished by law as nonimmigrants who intend to permanently immigrate. There are currently four K-type visas. The K-1 and K-2 type visas are targeted toward foreign fiancés (i.e. not yet married) of U.S. citizens and their minor children, while the K-3 and K-4 type visas are meant to accommodate foreign spouses (already married) and children of spouses currently living abroad. The K-1, or “fiancé visa,” allows the future spouses of U.S. citizens to enter the United States in order to marry and ultimately apply for and adjustment to immigrant status. The K-1 limits couples to 90 days, within which they must get married and file the paperwork for adjustment in status. In practice, the K-1 serves as a nonimmigrant visa bridge to permanent spousal immigration status. In fact, the K-1 visa is listed on the State Department website in the immigrant visa section, just below IR-1 and CR-1 spousal immigrant visa types. The IR-1 immigrant visa is only applicable to foreign spouses who have been married to a U.S. citizen or permanent resident for more than 2 years, while the CR-1 visa applies to foreign spouses who have been married to a U.S. citizens less than 2 years.

      <h3>Why do K-1 visas exist?</h3>
      <p class = 'notbold'> K type visas were created to eliminate unnecessary family separations resulting from delays in immigrant visa adjudication for foreign fiancés and/or spouses (and family members of fiancés or spouses). The impetus to write the K-1 (and K-2) visas into law can be traced to two key factors related to globalization and the free movement of people. First, there became a growing need to adjust immigration law to facilitate U.S. soldiers trying to bring their foreign-born fiancés into the United States. Second, U.S. citizens were increasingly working, studying, and travelling abroad, which meant that an increasing number of Americans were also meeting, dating, and intending to marry non-U.S. citizens. The precedent for fiancé immigration was set after World War II, when temporary laws permitted U.S. soldiers to bring fiancés into the U.S. But by the late 1960s, those laws were long expired and an increasing number of U.S. Vietnam war soldiers were finding it difficult to return home with their foreign-born spouses. Because there was no provision in immigration law for fiancés of U.S. citizens to enter the United States to marry, soldiers had to file for marriage in both Vietnam and the U.S., and were often unable to effectively fulfill the requirements of both. Additionally, there existed a need to provide an avenue for the increasing number of non-military individuals who also wanted to marry foreign-born spouses. From the 1960s onwards, globalization, and the international mobility that accompanied it, drove an increase in the number of U.S. citizens marrying (and intending to marry) non-U.S. citizens. However, the same issues that made it difficult for soldiers to legally return to the U.S. with foreign fiances or spouses caused unnecessary delays and family separations.

      <h1 class = 'title'>The K-1 Visa: In Perspective</h1>
      <p class = 'notbold'> K-1 visas make up a minute portion of total nonimmigrant and immigrant visas and, in any given year, new K-1 visa holders would struggle to fill a major sports arena. K-1 visa issuances increased slightly over the past 12 years, but increases in other nonimmigrant and other spousal immigrant visa issuances (such as the IR-1 and CR-1) have generally outpaced the K-1. That said, recent K-1 petition approval and denial data show a decline in the number of approvals over the past two years. <strong>Total annual K-1 visa grantees would not fill most major sports stadiums.</strong> The total annual admissions of all new K-1 visa holders in 2017 (35,000) was just below the average daily attendance of a New York Yankees baseball game (39,400) in the same year. In fact, yearly admissions of K-1 visa holders has been well below the average single game attendance at Yankee stadium for every year since 2005.

B type visas, which are temporary entry visa for business and tourism, make up the vast majority of annual nonimmigrant visas.

IR type visas, which are family-based visa, make up the majority of annual new arrival immigrant visas. Further, immigrant spousal visas (IR-1 and CR-1) saw significantly more new entries than the K-1.

      <h1 class='title'>The K-1 Visa: Trends in Annual Entries</h1>
      <p class = 'notbold'> <strong>The overall trend in K-1 visas has remained remarkably consistent over the past 12 years.</strong> Annual K-1 visa admissions ranged from a low of 24,000 in 2011 to a high of 37,000 in 2016. There has been some variation from year to year, but the number of K-1 visas issued in 2017 (35,000) is only slightly higher than the number issued in 2005 (just under 33,000). Meanwhile, immigrant spousal visas (such as the IR-1 and CR-1) increased significantly. The yearly number of CR-1 visas issued has risen by 58 percent compared to 2005. The IR-1 visa has seen a 200 percent increase in issuances compared to 2005. Between 2015 and 2017, the IR-1 issuances have averaged 76,000 per year, which is more than three times the number of issuances in 2005.

  </div>
  <div class = 'container-fluid'>
    <div class = 'row'>
      <p class = 'notbold'>Some of the increase in IR-1 and CR-1 visas may be attributed to the phasing out of the K-3 visa. Starting in 2010, the K-3 was essentially eliminated as an option and many of those who would have previously applied for the K-3 may now be applying for CR-1 visas. However, given the size of the spike, the elimination of the K-3 is unlikely to be the only driver of increase in IR-1 visas. <strong>I-129F petition approvals data suggests a slight increase in K-1 issuances in 2018.</strong> USCIS quarterly data on the I-129F petition shows that approvals are down in 2017 and 2018 (compared to the previous two years). In 2015 and 2016, an average of 49,000 I-129F petitions were approved. In 2017 and 2018 an average of 34,000 petitions were approved. I-129F denials are also up—from and average of 7,400 in 2015 and 2016 to 9,300 in 2017 and 2018—but the lion’s share of the decline in approvals can be traced to an increase in pending petitions. In 2015, the average number of pending petitions (by quarter) was 18,000, but in 2018 that number skyrocketed to 29,000.

The bulk of K-1 Visa holders go to our most populous states: California, Florida, Texas, and New York. <strong>Filipino K-1 visas dwarf every other nationality.</strong> In 2017, Filipino citizens accounted for nearly 7,000 of the 35,000 K-1 entrants.

Citizens of large East European and East Asian countries saw declines in K-1 visas. China, Russia, and Ukraine all saw significant declines in K-1 visas since 2005.

      <p class = 'notbold'>
        To explore K-1 demographic data, we used information from a sample of recent RapidVisa customers. The RapidVisa dataset used for analysis below is a sample of 8,000 K-1 sponsors and applicants between the years 2014 and 2018. The data are not an unbiased representation of all K-1 sponsors and applicants, but rather a descriptive snapshot of sample of K-1 applicants and sponsors who have enlisted K-1 application assistance services. The average RapidVisa K-1 sponsor is a middle aged, white male. Over 80 percent of RapidVisa (RV) sponsors are male. The median age of sponsors is 42, which is 2 years higher than the median age in the United States. Over 60 percent of sponsors are Caucasian, 15 percent are African-American, and 14 percent are Hispanic/Latino.

        The average RapidVisa K-1 applicant is a female in her late 20s. Just under 78 percent of RV applicants are female and over 40 percent are from the Philippines. The share of RV applicants who are Filipinos is double the share of total K-1 recipients who are Filipino. Despite that, the distribution of countries in the RV sample is similar to that of total K-1 entrants - seven of the top ten applicant countries in the RV sample are also in the top ten of total K-1 visa entrants in 2017.

        Same-sex couples make up a small portion of K-1 visas. Same-sex couple couples made up only about 6 percent of the total RV K-1 applications. Though it is a very small sample, the demographic characteristics of same-sex couples are similar to those of opposite-sex couple. The most cited sponsor occupations are drivers, business owners, and retirees. Occupational data gives a window into the who most sponsors are. The highest are drivers, business owners, and the retired, with set incomes at or near US median wages. However, individuals with high incomes, including doctors, financial advisors, and business executives also make up a significant portion of sponsors.

        Close to a third of K-1 applicants are in no-wage occupations. Twenty percent of all applicants entered “unemployed” as their job and 8 percent entered “student.” That said, 70 percent of applicants cited a job or occupation; entries ranged from domestic worker to sales executive to zoo-keeper. But, because the occupation range is wide and many applicants entered a unique job title, it is difficult to pull out broader applicant job takeaways. K-1 sponsor average income is on the low end. Median K-1 sponsor income is about 45,000 per year, which is nearly 15,000 less the the United States median income. That said, extremely high income individuals make up a significant portion of K-1 sponsors—13 percent of sponsors make more than 100,000 per year.
